Good coding practices
=====================

Good coding practices for scientific programming.

Github pages front-end is [here](http://cogrhythms.github.io/good-coding-practices/).

The wiki itself is [here](https://github.com/cogrhythms/good-coding-practices/wiki).

We would be happy if you find the wiki useful. We will be even happier if you help improve it by adding new coding tips, links to great packages/libraries, or polishing text. Just make sure to follow a few simple guidelines:

* Check that your tip or package is not already listed
* Carefully choose an appropriate page and section for your entry
* Write with [readability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability) in mind
* Take on a friendly and fun writing style
* Add links to pages with detailed explanations when appropriate
* Use [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for text styling
* Always add a short descriptive "edit message" to your page edits before submitting

The repository consists of the scientific code examples from other scientists. Feel free to browse, download, and play with these scripts. They are here to demonstrate different coding styles. If you want to contribute your own code, fork the repository, add a folder with your code, give it your name ("first_last"), and submit a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Have fun coding!
